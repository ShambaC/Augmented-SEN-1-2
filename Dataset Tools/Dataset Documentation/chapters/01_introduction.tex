The TUM Sentinel 1-2 dataset\cite{tumsen12} is widely used in various remote sensing computer vision tasks. It consists of 282,384 pairs of SAR and optical images. This massive amount of data has enabled various applications of deep generative networks in the field of remote sensing\cite{Zhang2023}.

In this extension of the dataset, we have augmented it with an addition of XX pairs of SAR and optical images, increasing the diversity and coverage. Furthermore, we have introduced a novel temperature region annotation for each image, providing valuable metadata that we believe will enable better research workflow. This augmented dataset facilitates more precise and context-aware deep learning models for tasks such as SAR to optical image translation.

This paper provides an overview of the dataset extension, its structure, the methodology of acquiring the data, and some use cases.
