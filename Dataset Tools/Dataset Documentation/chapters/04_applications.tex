The applications for this dataset remains unchanaged, excpet for one method in SAR optical translation. Due to the new heat zone data in the dataset, optical translation methods can benefit from it by adding text conditioning to the task. So, text based image generation models like stable diffusion can now be used to perform the said task. This opens up new possibilities and even betterment of SAR to optical image translations.
