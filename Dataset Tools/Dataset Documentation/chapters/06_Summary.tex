With this article, we described and released the Augmented SEN1-2 dataset which contains XX pairs of SAR and optical images sourced from various locations around the earth. We believe that this will help in further development in SAR image research field.

For the future of this dataset, we do not have any further plans on updating this dataset. We may update it in the future if an update for the SEN1-2 dataset releases. We will update this augmentation to match the then version of the original dataset.
