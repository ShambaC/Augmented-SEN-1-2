The SEN1-2 dataset contains 282,384 pairs of SAR and optical image patches extracted from versatile Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 scenes. These are $256\times256$ RGB images in png format. The images (or patch pairs) were selected by randomly selecting various regions (called scenes) and then segregated into four different seasons. The following table states the structure of the dataset in numbers:
