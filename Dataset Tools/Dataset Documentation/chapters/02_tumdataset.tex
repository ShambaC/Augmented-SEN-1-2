The SEN1-2 dataset contains 282,384 pairs of SAR and optical image patches extracted from versatile Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 scenes. These are $256\times256$ RGB images in png format. The images (or patch pairs) were selected by randomly selecting various regions (called scenes) and then segregated into four different seasons. The following table states the structure of the dataset in numbers:

            Seed & Season & Scenes & Pairs \\
            \hline
            1158 & Spring & 70 & 75,724 \\
            1868 & Summer & 49 & 53,508 \\
            1970 & Fall & 78 & 86,370 \\
            2017 & Winter & 61 & 66,782 \\

The following points explain the significance of each column:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Seed:} The number used to seed the RNG for the selection of the region.
    \item \textbf{Season:} The time period from the time the image is taken.
    \item \textbf{Scenes:} The total number of regions chosen globally.
    \item \textbf{Pairs:} The total number of patch pairs or pairs of images from all regions for that particular season.
\end{itemize}
