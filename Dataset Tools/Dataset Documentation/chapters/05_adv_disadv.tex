This extended SEN1-2 Dataset has increased the already large amount of data present in the original dataset. That in itself is an advantage as more training data is always a good criteria for developing better machine learning models. Moreover, we augmented the dataset with textual information. This provides an additional advantage by allowing the usage of models that can process text data. We, believe this will open up better oppurtunities for researchers.

This dataset does not add any disadvantages on top of the ones already present. The major existing drawback is the lack of bands in S2 images. Only the RGB bands are used in the images whereas having multiple other available bands can help in better spectral analysis of the images.
