        \begin{abstract}
            Deep learning techniques are having a major impact on every technical fields now-a-days and gathering sufficient amounts of training data was challenging in the space of remote sensing. This problem was solved by the Sen 1-2 dataset\cite{tumsen12}. The dataset contains almost 300,000 pairs of SAR and optical images across multiple seasons and regions. We have extended the dataset with an additional XX pair of images. Furthermore, the dataset has been augmented with temperature region information for all images. We believe that this data augmentation will help in the progression of various SAR image applications.
