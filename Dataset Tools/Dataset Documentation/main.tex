        \begin{abstract}
            Deep learning techniques are having a major impact on every technical fields now-a-days and gathering sufficient amounts of training data was challenging in the space of remote sensing. This problem was solved by the Sen 1-2 dataset\cite{tumsen12}. The dataset contains almost 300,000 pairs of SAR and optical images across multiple seasons and regions. We have extended the dataset with XX more pair of images. Also the dataset has been augmented with temperature region information for all images. We believe that this extra data will further help in SAR images application.
